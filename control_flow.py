--- while STATEMENTS ---
while (condition == true):
    print("something") -> this will be performed repeatedly until condition == false

The while statement requires that at some point the condition will become false, otherwise
we are trapped in an infinite loop.

If we need a "safety net" for the while-loop to terminate, then we can use a break
statement.

the "break" statement will terminate the loop even if the condition inside the
corresponding "while" is true
